Hello there!

My name is Thibaut LE LEVIER.

I’m a soft­ware de­veloper (iOS mostly), and as­pir­ing en­tre­pren­eur.

I’m work­ing on iOS de­vel­op­ment since 2009, I also do some backend de­vel­op­ment (Rails, Sinatra or Node.js) and I know enough about Linux ad­min­is­tra­tion to setup the first server of my next pro­ject.

For now I’m work­ing as a freel­ance con­tractor and I’m based in Paris.

Feel free to [con­tact me](/contact/) if you want to talk about your pro­ject, or if you just want to grab a beer!
